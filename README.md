## Description
I forked this reposity from ramen-at-piece's youtube-bookmarker-starter-code. I fixed a couple bugs: 1) one prevented the add timestamp button from working (background.js), and 2) another caused erratic behavior when deleting timestamps, such as multiple timestamps being deleted at once. I also refined the add timestamp feature to prevent duplicate timestamps from displaying and include milliseconds in the timestamp display.
